### Some key pointers:
* Unlike his brother (who was kidnapped to Sweden at a very young age), Tor-Björn is calmly assertive yet aggressive at the same time.
* Tor-Björn has spent years perfecting his Pong skills inside a Cube.
* He assimilates his opponents with totally obscure slams.
* He memorizes his opponents every move.
* He has lightning fast (< 90ms) reflexes.
* He is always one step ahead of his opponents.
* Offense is the best defense. Not for him. Usually.
* Resistance is futile.


#### Tor-Björn takes orders from nobody, but in order to get the game going:
* Build.sh for building
* Start.sh (player name, hostname, port) for playing
* Start-duel.sh (player name, opponent name, hostname, port) for dueling
